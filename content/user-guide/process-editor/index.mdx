# Creating Processes in the Process Editor

The _Process Editor_ view in PROCEED allows you to create, manage, delete, and release business processes. 
It is intended for process owners and designers.
In contrast, the read-only [_Process List_](process-list) view is intended for regular employees who need to understand, interact with, or execute existing business processes.
