Processes are created inside the Management-System. For a decentralized
execution the process steps needs to be transfered to multiple network-connected
systems with an installed distributed process engine. The PROCEED BPMS supports
_2 types of deployment_: a static deployment and a dynamic deployment.

## Static Deployment

Static deployment means that the created process (the so-called
_parent_-process) is separated into several, smaller _child_ processes. This is
done by the process creator at design-time inside the management system. Every
child process is then assigned to an IT system, which runs the PROCEED engine
and has the necessary capability.

Afterwards the deployment can be done: every child is transferred to the
assigned system and waits for executing its part of the entire parent process.
The process starts on a system that contains a start event and can be triggered
manually (e.g. in case of a BPMN empty start event with the Management System
via the API) or automatically (if a catching event waits for the trigger event).

## Dynamic Deployment

Dynamic deployment means that the created process is deployed to a device which
is capable of running the _first_ process step(s). After each step the process
engine evaluates if it is able to run the next step or if it needs to send the
packaged process to another engine that is capable of executing it. This further
deployment can also be enforced due to other constraints, e.g. the physical
location or workload. This means one process literally _jumps_ from machine to
machine, and thereby can even travel above network boundaries, if it is
transported with a portable device. This is done until every process instance
reaches its ends.

## Offline Execution

Distributed Processes Engines don't need any active connections to other engines, systems or coordinators. The process execution can happen completely independently.

If a process needs the capabilities of another system or device for fulfulling the next process steps (which is the usual case), the engine waits until such system is available.

If the process engine is working to its capacity, it rejects new incoming processes or execution requests

Open questions:

- Should there be a configuration option for a wait maximum?
- Do waiting processes have influence on system performance?
- How to prevent infinite process execution? Do we need to prevent that?
- How to design the software components for waiting/listing?
- Esp. for IoT devices: how to prevent new processes or execution requests? Maybe include a waiting queue?
