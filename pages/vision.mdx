# PROCEED Basics

Make BPMN-based process engine cooperate,  
Integrate IoT devices,  
Let every process be individual,  
And make all of that in a user-friendly, resilient and secure way.

---

In a world with more and more connected and data-collecting devices for every
company and IoT vendor who wants to easily create and deploy _individual_,
_interoperable_, _IoT-ready_ processes
{/* while respecting the customers privacy */}
PROCEED offers a _decentralized Business Process Management System_
(dBPMS) that

- distributes parts of an executable BPMN process to different systems,
- dynamically integrates the capabilities of surrounding IoT devices and
- incorporates the customers and companies security profiles.

Unlike other centralized process engines our project enables businesses to ship
processes closer to the customer, and to execute them in a decentralized,
resilient environment, where different vendors cooperate to achieve the process
goal.
