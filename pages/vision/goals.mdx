The main goal of the PROCEED project is to spread the process execution so that
processes are executed on multiple, distributed process engines without a
connection to a coordinating server or management system. {/* This leads to the
distribution of the process engine in contrast to typical Client-Server systems.
*/}

{/* Anmerkungen Andreas Kronz bei Scheer Treffen:
- mehr Blockchain Wording anschauen und benutzen
- wie passt die Engine in die etablierten Prozessumgebungen/Prozesse
  (ERP-Systeme)?
- wo passt die Engine rein (Prozessorientierte IoT-Steuerungsplattform
  unabhängig von etablierten IoT Lösungen anderer Anbieter ) */}

**IoT Integration**:
One of the main goals is the coordination of multiple IoT devices in a process.

- IoT devices run on a multitude of different platforms. The PROCEED execution
  engine offers a generic architecture to support a big variety of platforms.
- IoT devices are constraint systems with sensors and actuators that offer a
  wide variety of capabilities from regulating the heating to printing 3D
  figures.

**Fog Processes**:
Process steps are directly executed on the involved or nearby devices.

**Portable Processes**:
Processes can be transported to and continued in other environments.

**Interoperable Processes**:
Using and defining standards for executing distributed processes so that it can
run on every compliant process engine.

{/* - was hat das für eine Konsequenz: Capability, Prozessweitergabe, Lokale
Ausführung - Autonom? */}

**Context-aware Processes**:
Depending on the availability of (surrounding) systems, the process execution
can adapt to current circumstances.

**Privacy-aware Processes**:
Processes that involve private data respect privacy profiles of process
participants. {/* e.g. by partly process data on site, removing the need to
transfer all data to an external service. */}

**Enterprise-aware Processes**:
Parts of a process can be created by different companies and integrated into one
process without leaking internal process details.

**Smart process interaction**:
PROCEED offers new ways to create and interact with processes.
