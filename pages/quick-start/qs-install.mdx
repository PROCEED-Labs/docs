### Installation of PROCEED Components

There are two essential pieces of PROCEED components, the management system and
the distributed process engine. The approriate release builds for your platform
can be downloaded from [the engine installation page](/downloads/engine-install)
and [the management system installation page](/downloads/ms-install)

### Connect the Process Engines to the Management System

This part of the quick start focuses on running the engine and the management
system on your platform.

#### Starting the distributed engine

- Unzip the distributed engine that was previously downloaded.
- With the current working directory set to the unzipped folder, run the command
  `npm start` from your terminal/console.

The last step will start the distributed engine, its associated components and
start listening for HTTP requests in ports 3000, 3050 and 8080. Therefore, make
sure the listed ports are not allocated to other processes in your system. Press
`Ctrl+D` or `Ctrl+C` depending on your platform to exit the process.

#### Starting the PROCEED management system

- Unzip the downloaded bundle

#### For Mac

- The unzipped bundle contains an app that is readily executable
- Mac security may warn that the software is from an unidentified developer,
  ignore that warning and add an exception via System Preferences > Security &
  Privacy > Open Anyway

#### For Linux

- Download the .snap or .AppImage file
- Installing with snap: With the current directory set to the folder containing
  the .snap file, run the command `snap install --dangerous
management-system_0.1.0_amd64.snap`
- Running the AppImage: Make the .AppImage file executable, doubleclick the
  .AppImage file

#### For Windows

- Download the .exe installation file
- Trying to run it will show a warning that the app is unrecognized. Click on
  'More info' and the 'Run anyway' button will appear. Installing the
  application will create a Desktop icon from where you can directly open the
  management system.

#### Adding the engine to the management system as a machine

With the engine running in the background, this step will add the engine
instance as a machine to the management system. In the management system, click
on the "Machines" item in the left menu.

The managament system is able to find running engines and add them automatically
under Machines. If the engine is working properly, a green symbol will appear
next to the machine IP-adress.

If your machines are not added automatically, you can also add them manually by
following the instructions: Click on the "Add" button on the top-right, which
will present a popup.
![add_machine](/images/quick-start-install/add_machine.png)

Enter a Hostname or an IP Address for the machine (at least one is required, the
other one will appear automatically once the machine gets available), for e.g.
`192.168.10.22` or a Hostname like `my-mbp.local` and click add to add it.
Optionally, you can also add a custom Name of your machine. Once added, the
management system will automatically look for the engine in the given location
and display a green symbol next to it as soon as the connection is established.

Repeat the previous step to add as many machines as required. Proceed to the
next page for [creation of a process](qs-create-process). The below image
illustrates what your screen might look like on adding multiple machines.

(Tip: to run simulate multiple machines, use VirtualMachines in a private
network and run a PROCEED engine in each of them.)
