## Behavior of Process Data

Process objects are currently created within _user_ or _script tasks_. The [user
guide](/user-guide/modelling/process-data) describes how to do it. Created process
objects are stored within a named variable. The value of the variable is a [JSON
data
type](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-404.pdf),
which is either a `string, number, boolean, null/empty, object`, or `array`.

A process object is accessible within the process level and all of its
sub-processes or tasks. If two activities write in parallel to the same
variable, the latest executions wins and overrides the value. This is a little
bit different with a running _call activity_, because it is started as a
completely separated process. Therefore, the current process variables are
copied into the call activity execution at its start. After its execution, all
_changed_ or _new_ variables from the call activity process are copied into the
parent process. So, this maybe overrides a process variable at the end of the
execution.

Moreover, within PROCEED it can happen that parts of the process are executed on
another Machine. When two parts are _merged_ on one Machine, newer variables
changes override older values.
