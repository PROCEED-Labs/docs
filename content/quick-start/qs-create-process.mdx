### Create a small process

In this tutorial, we will create a simple process which will cover the following concepts.

- Creating a new Folder and Process in the Editor Table
- Design a BPMN-based Process and add some Meta Information
- Share and Copy the Process

#### Defining the process with a BPMN diagram

- Define a simple process by clicking "Process Management" in the menu and
  clicking "Add" on the top-right. This will open the process creation popup.

- Provide the process with a name, e.g. "First Process". You can optionally add
  variables to the process by clicking "Add Variable". Once done, click "Add
  Process" to finish creation.

- The process that was just created will be in the list of processes. For each
  process, you can change the name and variables simply by clicking the process
  you want to modify. You can also delete the process, edit the BPMN diagram and
  deploy with the corresponding action buttons.

- For the newly created process, click the edit icon to create a BPMN diagram
  like below using the editor.
  ![simple_process_bpmn](/images/quick-start-create-process/simple_process_bpmn.png)
  The above BPMN represents a simple process with a start state, two activities
  and an end-state, linearly linked. The end result should look like the
  following figure,

- Convert "Activity 1" to a script-task by right-clicking the activity and
  clicking the spanner icon, as illustrated in the following figure.
  ![simple_process_convert_to_script_task](/images/quick-start-create-process/simple_process_convert_to_script_task.png)

You should now see and icon on the top-left of the activity.
![script_task_activity_1](/images/quick-start-create-process/script_task_activity_1.png)

- Clicking on any script task will display a button on the top of the BPMN
  editor to provide/edit the script for the task.
  ![edit_script_action](/images/quick-start-create-process/edit_script_action.png)

![script_editing_ide](/images/quick-start-create-process/script_editing_ide.png)

The editor expects Javascript, for activity 1 enter the following script,

```js
services.console.log('Hello world');
```

- To run the processes on separate machines, right-click the activity and open
  the machines menu by clicking the machine icon, then select a machine from the
  menu on which the activity should run. If the machine is currently connected,
  a green circle will appear next to it.

- At this stage, the separated processes should look like the below figure,
  ![separated_processes](/images/quick-start-create-process/separated_processes.png)
  This indicates activities of different colors will run on different machines.

- Click "Save" from the top-right actions to save your changes. Optionally, you
  can view the XML for the BPMN by clicking the "XML" button and also the
  separated processes using the "Show Separated Button".

The task id and the process uuid are displayed for debugging purposes

- As a final step, go back to the processes list, corresponding to "First
  Process", click the corresponding deploy button to send the process XML and
  associated data to the machines. The next step, go to the "Execution" tab in
  the menu to execute the process on the machines.
