### Organizing Processes

In this section, we will quickly show how you can organize your processes into folders to maintain a structured and efficient workspace
in the PROCEED editor.

Using the three-dotted button next to **Create Process**, or by right-clicking on empty space, you can create new folders to organize your processes.

We recommend structuring your folders by **department**, **function**, or **process type**, depending on what best suits your team's workflow.
For example, you might create folders like **HR**, **Finance**, or **Operations** to keep related processes grouped together.
You can also nest folders to reflect your organizational hierarchy — for instance, placing an Onboarding folder inside the HR folder.

To customize your view, use the three-dotted button in the top-right corner of the table to display additional properties.
You can sort columns by clicking on their headers, making it easier to locate specific items.
In the top-right corner, an arrow button allows you to toggle detailed meta-data for the currently selected item.

You can switch to a **tile view** using the button in the top-right corner of the workspace. This layout will also display preview images of your processes
to make it easier to quickly recognize processes visually. To open a folder you now have to double-click it.

You can also **drag and drop** processes to move them between folders — this works seamlessly in both list and tile view. To move a process up one level,
you can drag it onto the Parent Folder entry at the top of the list.

By right-clicking a process, you gain access to additional actions such as opening the process in a **new tab**, copying a direct link to **share** with others,
or creating a **duplicate**.

You also have the option to **export** one or multiple processes directly from this view using the action bar at the top. This allows you to quickly back up,
share, or transfer processes as needed.
