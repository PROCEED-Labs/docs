The Management System (MS) creates, manages and monitors the execution of
processes. It exists as a Desktop application and there is also a Server
version. A limited version without Machine discovery in the network can be
tested on: https://proceed-server.snet.tu-berlin.de/

## MS Desktop Version

The Management System can be downloaded as a Desktop Version for Linux, Windows
and Mac OS under the following links.

- [Windows](https://storage.googleapis.com/proceed-releases/ms/PROCEED-Management-System-0.1.0.exe)  
- [Mac](https://storage.googleapis.com/proceed-releases/ms/PROCEED-Management-System-0.1.0.dmg)\*  
- [Linux
Snap](https://storage.googleapis.com/proceed-releases/ms/PROCEED-Management-System-0.1.0.snap)  
- [Linux
AppImage](https://storage.googleapis.com/proceed-releases/ms/PROCEED-Management-System-0.1.0.AppImage)\*\*

Usually you just need to double click the file and the Management System starts.

\*) Because this is a running, still highly-changing project, the Mac OS Desktop
Version is not yet signed. Therefore, on Mac OS it usually requires you to allow
the execution at the first start of the app. Open the Security & Privacy setting
and accept the _PROCEED-Management-System_ at the bottom by clicking on _Open
Anyway_ and then _Open_.

![Mac OS Security Settings for the PROCEED
MS](/images/installation/PROCEED-MS-Mac-Security.png?width=500px)

\*\*) The _.AppImage_ needs to get execution rights before you can run it. This
can be done with `chmod a+x PROCEED-Management-System-x.x.x.AppImage`).

<Callout type="info">
  The Management System also integrates a [PROCEED Engine](engine-install), which
  you can start inside the graphical interface via _File_ -> _Turn Engine On_ or
  by clicking on the PROCEED logo in the bottom left corner. For the Engine to work
  properly -- especially on Mac and Windows -- you have to allow the program in the
  Firewall.

## MS Server Version

The server version of the Management System is a little bit more complex to
start, because it requires to set up an Identity Management and more advanced
knowledge about Docker. Unfortunately, not everything is yet fully documented.
The best place to start and get help is the repository:
https://github.com/PROCEED-Labs

# Additional Systems

For some cases there is additional software needed. The following sections
describe the installation and configuration of these systems for PROCEED.

## User Management Database

_Users_ and _Roles_ that get assigned to _User Tasks_ can be created and managed
inside the Management System. Since the MS is not a centralized application,
especially for companies it is usually more useful to have a user management on
a central server. In this section it is explained how this server is setup and
how to configure the Management System to connect to this server.

The section concepts describes the functional perspective of the elements that
are installed here:

## 1. Setup LDAP

1.1.) Start a Docker container with OpenLDAP as follows:

```
docker run -p 10389:389 --name my-openldap --env LDAP_ORGANISATION="example" --env LDAP_DOMAIN="example.org"  --env LDAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD="admin"  --env LDAP_CONFIG_PASSWORD="config" --detach osixia/openldap:1.2.4
```

1.2) Enter two organization units People and Group in your LDAP. Save entries in
file.ldiff

```
dn: ou=People,dc=proceed,dc=com
objectClass: organizationalUnit
ou: People

dn: ou=Groups,dc=example,dc=org
objectClass: organizationalUnit
ou: Groups
```

Add the file.ldiff to your LDAP:

```
LDAP_CID=$(docker run --hostname ldap.example.org --env LDAP_REPLICATION=true --detach osixia/openldap:1.2.4)
LDAP_IP=$(docker inspect -f "{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}" $LDAP_CID)
docker exec $LDAP_CID ldapadd -x -D "cn=admin,dc=proceed,dc=com" -w admin -f file.ldiff -H ldap://ldap.example.org -ZZ
```

1.3.a)

Enter LDAP IP Address (localhost), LDAP Port(10389), LDAP admin DN
(cn=admin,dc=proceed,dc=com) and LDAP password(admin) in Management System.
Please note that the password is transmitted without being obfuscated. It is
recommended to use an encrypted connection (SSL/TLS) which PROCEED at the moment
does not offer. To underline this issue the password is stored as clear text.
The LDAP admin DN and LDAP passwords are internally used to create an LDAP bind
request. It firstly consists of the DN of the user to authenticate. This could
be left empty for anonymous simple authentication
(https://ldap.com/the-ldap-bind-operation/) Secondly the credential for the user
to authenticate must be included. For simple authentication, this is the
password for the user specified by the bind DN.

![Overview User Management
System](/images/architecture/usermanagement_addldap.jpg?width=600px&classes=shadow,border)

1.4) optional: Secure Passwords if needed

Create a tmp.ldiff File:

```
dn: cn=config
changetype: modify
add: olcPasswordCryptSaltFormat
olcPasswordCryptSaltFormat: $6$%.16s
-
add: olcPasswordHash
olcPasswordHash: {CRYPT}
```

Add this configuration to LDAP with ldapmodify. Make sure to use the account
that has config privileges which is usually not 'admin'. You find the
credentials in the file olcDatabase={0}config.ldif. The password in docker image
osixia/openldap:1.2.4 can be set by environment variable LDAP_CONFIG_PASSWORD
(here:config). With $6$ tmp.ldiff sets Hash to: SHA-512 Hash and 16s means that
we store a 16 char salt.

```
ldapmodify -h localhost -D "cn=admin,cn=config" -w config -p 10389 -a -f tmp.ldiff
```

## 2. SetUp openIdProvider with KeyCloack

2.1) Start a Docker container with Keycloack:

```
docker run -p 8080:8080 --name keycloak1 jboss/keycloak
```

2.2) Create an admin account within KeyCloak:

```
docker exec keycloak1 keycloak/bin/add-user-keycloak.sh -u admin -p admin
```

2.3) Restart keycloack

```
docker restart keycloak1
```

# 3. Add LDAP to keycloack

#### 3.1) Click on Administration Console at AdminConsole: http://localhost:8080/auth/

#### 3.2.) Login with your credentials from 2.2 (user: admin / pw:admin)

#### 3.3.)

On User Federation create a new LDAP with the following values:

# 5. Add openIdConnect to keycloack

1. Add Client to keycloack

Client Protocol: openid-connect Acces Type: confidential

2. Add Group Mappers: We need to add a Group Mappers that injects the Groups in
   the access token: 1. Click on "Clients" 2. Select your client 3. Click on
   Mappers 4. Click Create:

Name: groups  
Mapper Type: Group Membership  
Token Claim Name: groups  
other Values: default

## 6. Management-System Interface

Users and Roles are automatically fetched from LDAP. To add user directly one
can click on 'Add User' and fill in the input fields. Same holds for Roles. If
you are wokring on a User Task, click on the User Task and click on the small
User Icon appearing (HoverText: Select Users/Roles). You can now assign a User
or a Role to a User Task.
