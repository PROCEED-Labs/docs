# Download and Share created Business Processes

PROCEED's Management System can import and export processes.
Importing is useful to transfer a BPMN process into the MS.
With the Export you are able to backup the process, create pictures or generate PDFs out of it.

## Download of Processes

Exporting BPMN processes can be done in many formats: PDF, PNG, SVG and BPMN.
Some additional options can be configured:

- For PDF, you can export an image of the BPMN process along with or without the title.
- For PNG, you can export the image with a default resolution or you change the resolution.
- For BPMN, you can export only the BPMN file or you can select to also export the associated HTML files for user tasks and the referenced processes from a call activity (this creates a zip file).
- For SVG, there are no additional options.

You can export either one process or multiple processes at once.

### Single Download

Single export can be initiated by clicking the export button for one process inside the datatable view, the card view, or inside the BPMN editor.
A popup will appear and the desired output format can be selected.
After clicking on the blue _Export_ button at the bottom, a popup will appear to store the file at the desired location.

Multiple exports can be initiated by selecting multiple processes in the datatable view (via the check-boxes) or by selecting all processes in card view (with the _Select All_ button).
At the top, the _Select Action_ button will be enabled.
By clicking on it, you can export all selected processes.
A ZIP file will be created containing all processes.
