# PROCEED User Documentation

PROCEED is an open-source Business Process Management System (BPMS) specialized on the intelligent and user-friendly creation, execution and monitoring of processes.
It uses AI features and the industry-standard BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) combined with an intuitive interface to let anyone visually design workflows, foster collaboration and empower employees to act autonomously.

PROCEED enables companies to document their processes and share them with all employees. This ensures that all standard procedures are clearly and unambiguously described.
