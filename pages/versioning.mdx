## Process Versioning Background:


- processes can be directly requested from an Engine and/or from a central
  storage repository
- MS can be a desktop application: there are multiple MS on different PCs
  without same database
  -  can be either _online_ (processes can be synchronized with a central
     storage) or offline (no connection to a central storage)  
- MS can be a server application with one db and multiple users
- multiple users can work on the same process at the same time collaboratively
  (only if online)
- _a User can be authenticated at multiple MS in parallel_ (I would like to
  avoid this, because this is not easy to achieve)

{/* Can you work offline on Google Docs? What happens if there are multiple
collaborators and they edit the document in the meantime? */}



## Process Versioning Requirements for PROCEED:

- a MS/User must always be able to create/edit/store/deploy a new or available
  process version at any time
  - either only offline (not synced), or as well online (synced)
- a MS/User must always be able to request/retrieve a stored process version
  directly from an Engine (not from other MS) and edit/redeploy it again
  - a User must be able to work offline on processes
- the collaborative approach must work

- a process version must be unique, have a name, date of the version creation,
  the creator of the version, a description, the date of the last change, the
  author of the last change
- the name and description of the version must be changeable 
- a new process can be based on a specific version of some other process
- the versions of a process must be sorted and indicate the relation between
  versions (tree structure)
- the versions of a process must be comparable
- a new process version should be created by hand 
  - to add meta data about the version 
  - to have not too much and only defined versions of a process (=>
    collaborative approach: no new version for every change)
- user friendly: no branches and merges 
  - merges probably make no sense for process diagrams


#### Not a requirement

- a version should be locally and globally (if online) deleteable
- every version can be reverted 


## Use Cases and Goals for Process Editing / Monitoring:

1. one synced process version on MS1 is deployed to engine, other MS2 (online)
   gets the version
   1. retrieved version is older than the synced version on MS2, because on MS1
      the work was continued
      - Process Edit MS2: let the user select which version to edit
      - Process Monitoring MS2: use retrieved version
   2. retrieved version is the same as the synced version on MS2, because on MS1
      the work was stopped
      - Process Edit MS2: let the user select which version to edit
      - Process Monitoring MS2: use retrieved version
2. one synced process version on MS1 is deployed to engine, other MS2 (offline)
   gets the version
   1. retrieved version on MS2 is older than the synced version in the repo
      (which is not synced), because on MS1 the work was continued
   2. retrieved version on MS2 is the same as the synced version in the repo
      (which is not synced), because on MS1 the work was stopped
      - Process Edit (BOTH CASES) MS2: the user can edit the retrieved version
      - Process Monitoring (BOTH CASES) MS2: use the retrieved version
3. one not synced process version on MS1 is deployed to engine, other MS2
   (online) gets the version
   1. version different on MS2 than on the synced server
      - Process Edit MS2: let the user select which version to edit
      - Process Monitoring MS2: use retrieved version
   1. current version on MS2, because the version already exists on the server
      - Process Edit MS2: let the user select which version to edit
      - Process Monitoring MS2: use retrieved version
   1. new version on MS2, because the version does not already exists on the
      server
      - Process Edit MS2: edit the retrieved version
      - Process Monitoring MS2: use retrieved version
4. one not synced process version on MS1 is deployed to engine, other MS2
   (offline) gets the version
   1. new or version on MS2, because the version does not already exists
      - Process Edit MS2: edit the retrieved version
      - Process Monitoring MS2: use retrieved version
   1. version different on MS2 than the existing ones
      - Process Edit MS2: let the user select which version to edit
      - Process Monitoring MS2: use retrieved version

## Nomenclature

**Parent Artifact** : The process description which is the BPMN XML file. It
contains Sub-Artifacts.

**Sub-Artifacts:** : Some file/resource needed in the process description, e.g.
the HTML file for user tasks, or scripts, constraints, attached documents, etc.




## General questions:

What happens if a new process is created? : _Answer:_ 
  - new `id`, etc.
  - new elements for the process: 
      - `proceed:ownerId` and `proceed:ownerName` 
      - if the process is based on another process, delete all collaborators
        (actually delete the whole meta information inside the extension element
        for _bpmn:process_)
      - if the process is based on another process, add this info
  - sync with the server if online


How is a process automatically synchronized with the server? : _Answer:_
  - a process is only sent to and stored on the server by the user that created
    the process (i.e. current authenticated user == owner)
      - in case the MS retrieved a process from an Engine, which is not on the
        server yet and where the owner is not the current user, the MS does not
        send the process to the server for storage
  - for collaboration the owner can add other users (inside the extension
    element for _bpmn:process_ `<proceed:collaborators>
    <proceed:collaboratorUser> <proceed:collaboratorGroup>`)

: _Background:_
  - a user can connect the MS to a server (+ authenticate), there he can:
     - store processes and reuse them on another MS (if authenticated)
     - participate in the collaborative editing of a process with other users
  - for user friendliness: the synchronization of every process change and every
    process version should be done in the background automatically without user
    interaction (if authenticated, all processes are stored automatically on the
    server)


What happens if an offline MS works on an existing process (changing the HEAD or
even creates a new process version) that was synced before and therefore in the
editable process list? : _Answer:_ 
  - if( collaborators != empty): there are other collaborators => create a
    complete new process based on the retrieved version)
  - if( user == owner && collaborators == empty): go on, work on the same
    process
      - **BIG Problem**: the same user can even be authenticated on multiple MS
        in parallel, e.g. Web Client and one MS. What happens if the MS goes
        offline and work is continued on both "MS"
          - this is actually the same problem with multiple collaborators
          - But it would be very nice for a user if he can also work offline on
            a process without creating a new process - **how to solve this?**
             1. if the MS goes online again, check if there was a change  in the
                meantime. if not, sync like described. if yes, give the User the
                opportunity to choose: Rewrite the server (+create copy),
                Rewrite the MS (+create copy) => this needs an identifier to
                indicate the `lastHead` (not last process version but the last
                modificationId, because also the unversioned HEAD is stored on
                the server)
             2. handle process like it has multiple other collaborators: create
                new processes if offline


What happens if the user was online (synced process with the server), goes
offline (not authenticated), created new processed or worked on some of its own
processes, then goes online again: : _Answer:_ 
  - if( process owner == current user && process == new): send all _new_
    processes to the server 
      - because of the authentication, the owner maybe has to change for every
        newly created process
  - if( current user == process collaborator): get processes form the server,
    override all processes and their version where the user is a collaborator
    (more efficient: compare if it is already stored)
  - if( process owner == current user && collaborators == empty && process ==
    changed): **TODO** see problem before 



What happens if a MS works on a retrieved process from an Engine (changing the
HEAD or even creates a new process version)? : _Answer:_ 
  - if (Online MS && (user == owner || user == collaborator) ): the process
should already be in the user's process list. So, he can work on it.   - if
(Online MS && (user != owner || user != collaborator) ): he can only create a
complete new process based on the retrieved version 
  - if (Offline MS && user == owner && collaborators == not empty): he can only
    create a complete new process based on the retrieved version
  - if (Offline MS && user == owner && collaborators == empty): no collaborators
    + the process should already be in the user's process list. So, he can work
    on it. (Reason: if you authenticate, you also sync all the processes with
    the server (or you are always offline) => the retrieved process should
    already be in the process list)
      - **PROBLEM: TODO** the same user can be authenticated on multiple Systems
        in parallel (Web and MS), see before
  - if (Offline MS && user != owner && user == collaborator): he can only create
    a complete new process based on the retrieved version
  - if (Offline MS && (user != owner || user != collaborator) ): he can only
    create a complete new process based on the retrieved version



: _Background:_
  - preferred would be if the ongoing work is put on the linear process history.
    but this is problematic because
     - multiple other persons can change the same process in parallel
       (collaboration approach or other offline MS) => no branches should be
       created and no merges
  - the MS  eventually goes online again, or sends the new version to an Engine
    (which is then retrieved by another MS already having the process in another
    version)
     - you can only add the retrieved version as a new version on top of
       existing one, if: local process _version timestamp_ >
       _lastModificationDate_ (since the creation of the last version, nothing
       was changed), then it can be easily integrated
     - if local process _version timestamp_ > _lastModificationDate_ : the
       process was changed on both MS (or on the Server) => how to combine these
       different processes?
        - a merge is too complicated, there complete new process




----


How is a version created? : _Answer:_ Manually, by hand, if there is some reason
to save the current status of the process
  
  
What is stored if you create a new version?

  - id (unique = date of the version creation in ms)
  - name (short description, can be Autofilled)
  - comment (Optional, long description)
  - author
  - indirect: lastModificationDate, lastModificationDateBeforeOffline


Are there extra attributes important for process versioning? : _Answer:_ 
  - `proceed:versionBasedOn`
  - `proceed:ownerId` and `proceed:ownerName` for stating the process owner
    (usually the creator, but the owner rights can maybe given to another
    user/role)


Do we need a _complete_ version history on all MS? : _Answer:_ No, it is okay,
if one version in the middle of the history is maybe missing : _Background:_
  - no really good reason for doing that (just fo seeing and tracking the
    versions, is no killer app)
  - it is very problematic too ensure the correct version history on offline MS
  - it can be a big overhead, if one previous version can be deleted 



How can versions of a process be sorted? : _Answer:_ the version contains a
timestamp, so it can be sorted after the time (_Problem:_ time synchronization
(which can probably not be solved for offline MS))
  - ~~2. Solution: the version references the previous process version, e.g.
    with `proceed:processIdBasedOn`  and `proceed:versionIdBasedOn`~~
     - ~~_Problem:_ 1. version deletion (see later, can also not be solved for
       offline MS), 2. to ensure a complete version history in the offline case
       you need to store the complete history inside the process, because an
       offline MS does not have every version~~


{/* How to store/get the complete version history of a process? _Problem:_ only
 have one version is not enough for our distributed, offline process handling,
 because an offline MS does not have every version
 1. only store the belonging version inside the BPMN Problem: if an Offline MS
      retrieves a new process version from an Engine, it does not know how it
      belongs to the existing processes
  1. store the complete version list inside the BPMN
      1. Problem: if an Online MS retrieves a new process version from an
         Engine, it needs to insert it into every BPMN Diagram and Sync it with
         the Server
      2. Problem: deletion of process versions */}



----

What process artifacts need to be versioned? (BPMN, HTML Views, Scripts,
Constraints, Machine Assignment, attached (binary) documents like a
Specification) : _Answer:_ 
  - All textual, process artifacts (BPMN, HTML, Scripts, etc.): external (e.g.
    HTML) and internal (e.g. Scripts, Constraints) artifacts belong to a version
  - No binary artifacts and no attached documents are versioned 


A new version for every _new_ static assignment? : _Answer:_ yes, because a
Machine Assignment is actually something like an assignment to a
role/participant (this is part of the process editing and should be visible for
everyone and stored inside a version)


Do Sub-Artifacts (Scripts, HTML, Constraints, etc.) get (separate) version
numbers? : _Answer:_ 
  - No, only the BPMN process gets a version number. Artifacts are linked (e.g.
    as files).
  - _But_: all linked artifacts get stored with a version. So, for every version
    there is a copy of all referenced artifacts.


Because we send multiple artifacts to an engine: can it happen that we just
update (the version) of only one artifact on the Engine without all other? :
_Answer:_ No, a deployment always sends all process artifacts of one version.


Is there a new version created for every deployment? : _Answer:_ it depends:
only defined versions get deployed
- => if the latest process change already has a version, then no new version
  needs to be created for deployment 
- => if you want to deploy a previous, then no new version needs to be created
- => if latest changes are not stored as a version, then (automatically) create
  a new version at deployment

: _Background:_ why are only defined versions deployed?
  - there is no new version created continuously for every change (because of
    the collaboration approach)
  - if you deploy a process, you usually want to deploy the latest changes
  - if deployed to an Engine and the process is modified during running on the
    Engine, there needs to be an indicator that the deployed version and the
    modified version are not the same anymore


How to find out if the version to be deployed is already the newest version or
an unversioned change? : _Answer:_ 
  
  - Solution 2: there is a last modification date and author stored within the
    BPMN (`proceed:lastModificationDate` + `proceed:lastModificationAuthor` 
      - **Problem:** time synchronization
  - ~~Solution 1: there is a unique random number (`proceed:modificationId`)
    stored within the BPMN~~
      - ~~this could be the event id, if there is one and if it is unique~~
      - ~~**Problem:** no info about the time and author of the last change~~
  - Both solutions require the info to be set with the change event (not as a
    second event) - possible? (Reason: for synchronizing we only should send one
    change event to all other clients, not multiple -- or else maybe leads to
    problems)
  - this last modification is always the local "HEAD"
  - before deployment it is checked if the HEAD last modification == last
    version last modification



------


You can see previous versions of a process. Can you change such a version and
what happens to _newer_ versions? : _Answer:_ It is not directly possible to
change a specific version of a process. If you want to do it, it always creates
a new process (id/name/etc.) based on the specified version

: _Background:_ if you can _change_ a previous version (i.e. not changing the
    version directly, but creating a new version/HEAD) and the process
    id/name/meta data stays the same, how to display this branch in the process
    list? - ~~Solution 1: delete all newer versions => then there is always only
    one branch of process, i.e. one process with a linear history (**Not
    wanted**)~~ - _Solution 2_: Starting editing a previous version means to
    create a completely new process (id/name/meta data), which can be displayed
    as a separate process


What happens if you create a new process based on another process version? :
_Answer:_ New id/name/meta data plus two extra attributes
`proceed:processIdBasedOn` and `proceed:versionIdBasedOn` indicating the base
and referring the original/previous version



Can you delete a specific version of a process? : _Answer:_ no : _Background:_ 
  - you or just an Admin could do it: the timestamp in the version keeps the
    sorting correct. This deleting is transferred to the sync server, so it gets
    deleted on all clients.
  - _Problem 1:_ what happens if an offline MS gets online again and has a
    deleted or new version of a process that it wants to synchronize? 
     - _Solution_: the version should stay deleted. therefore the server needs
       to keep a cache/blacklist with all already deleted versions of a process.
       if a MS syncs a process list, it would then delete the old version
  - _Problem 2:_ other processes can be based on another version of a process ->
    it is maybe not available anymore

Can you revert to a specific version of a process, i.e. delete all newer
version? : _Answer:_ no, not allowed (see version deletion)


Can you delete a complete process with all versions? : _Answer:_ yes, because
this is often a business requirement (maybe as a specific right in the user
management)

: _Problems:_ 
  - What happens with processes deployed on offline MS and Engines?
     - _Solution_: Keep a list of deleted processes and delete the process if
       the MS goes online again
     - _Problem_: What happens if the offline MS already created a new version
       based on the deleted process?
         - _Solution_: Create a new process (see "MS offline/online syn
           problem")


----------




How to start a process on the Engine? : _Answer:_ always start a specific
version of the process


How do the other tools do that? (BPMN Method and Style, Camunda, Signavio, ...)
: _Answer:_ 
  - Camunda creates a new version when a changed process definition is
    redeployed, running process instances will continue to run in the version
    they were started in, new process instances will run in the new version -
    unless specified explicitly. For more info  [See
    here](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.8/user-guide/process-engine/process-versioning/)
  - BPMN and Signavio have no attribute/element for process versioning






scenarios 
- MS goes from online to offline to online

#### Implementation: 


{/* - _Answer MS:_ store all versions of a process, deletion should be triggered
  - _Answer Engine:_ by default, store only the latest, non-running version of a
    process from a owner; a deletion should be triggerable from the MS  */}



{/* (if finished, add the information in the [BPMN Versioning page](ref
"bpmn-versioning.md")) */}

- How and where to describe the versions:
    
    - how does the version number look like? (date, v1, hash?)
        - _Answer:_ date in ms since 1970 (plus, we also get the date of the
          last change)

    - where should the version and the references to a versioned artifact be
      placed in BPMN? (e.g. in process-id or in new version-attribute?)
        - _Answer:_ 
        - BPMN file: file name and inside the BPMN XML with `proceed:version`
        - Sub-Artifacts (Internal): inside the BPMN XML with `proceed:version`
        - Sub-Artifacts (External): have file/resource name which is references
          inside the BPMN XML with `proceed:version`

    - how to version artifacts, that don't have BPMN XML structure? (e.g. HTML)
      (maybe just via a new URL endpoint, file name, or maybe via some meta HTML
      tag)
        - _Answer:_ with a new (file/resource) name for every version of an
          artifact
        
    - how does santhos BPMN engine handle versions?
        - problem: starting a part of a process must always start it in the
          correct version. example: a process is started at engine 1 and
          continued at engine 2 -- it must start the same version
          - this could be purely handled by the PROCEED surrounding
        - _Answer:_ Santhos engine probably doesn't need to handle it

- how are the versioned artifacts stored on the PROCEED engine and on the MS?
  (Git?)
    - _Answer:_ the process artifacts are stored in the same way on the MS and
      on the Engine like this:
        - process-id/ (folder)
            - process-id-version (BPMN)
            - process-id-version (BPMN)
            - user-tasks/ (folder)
                - html-id-version (HTML)
                - html-id-version (HTML)
    - a process version internally references sub-artifacts like the HTML files
      for user tasks
    - the name of the file/resource contains the version -- it can also be
      inside the file
    - we don't use git for versioning, because it bring to much complexity

- _Deployment_: what should be deployed to an Engine at process deployment?
  - _Answer:_ all artifacts (BPMN and sub-artifacts), even if they didn't change
  
- _Engine: Deployment and Storage_: what does the Engine, if a process
  deployment comes in?
  - _Answer:_ 
      - checks if the process id exists
      - checks if the process version exists
      - checks if the sub-artifacts version combination exists
      - if it is a new process or process version, sends it to the Garbage
        Collector for updating its _reference list_
      - overrides the files/resources that already exist 
      - depending on the configuration, triggers the Garbage Collector (GC)
        (must not execute immediately)

- _Storage_: how to delete process models, versions and artifacts? (on the MS
  and on the Engine)
  - delete all versions of a process: simple, just delete the whole process
    folder/resource, because it contains every artifact and will delete all
    sub-resources
  - delete a specific version of a process: - Problem: a referenced sub-artifact
        (e.g. HTML) can only be deleted, if no other process references it
        anymore - delete the version of the BPMN file and trigger the Garbage
        Collector
  - delete a specific sub-artifact: should not be possible

- _Storage_: what does the Garbage Collector (GC) do?
  - this depends on the Configuration
      - _StoreLastFromOwner_ (Default on Engine): delete all other (older and
        **newer**), non-running versions of the process from the same owner
      - _StoreLast_: delete all other (older and **newer**), non-running
        versions of the process
      - _StoreAll_ (Default on MS): keep every process version, just delete
        every unreferenced sub-artifact
  - the GC runs if regularly
  - the GC must go through all processes and create a _reference list_
      - the _reference list_ is stored to not be recreated every time, if
        nothing changed 
      - just checks if every file is still there
      - uses the reference list to delete unreferenced files
