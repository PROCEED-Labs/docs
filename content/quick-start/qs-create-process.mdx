### Create a small process

In this tutorial, we will create a simple process which will cover the following concepts:

- Creating a new folder and process in the editor table
- Becoming familiar with the UI of the editor
- Designing a BPMN-based process and adding some meta information

#### Getting started

Start by opening the **Processes** menu in the left section to navigate to the editor.
  ![navigate_to_editor](/images/quick-start-create-process/navigate_to_editor.png)

Click on the three-dotted button next to **Create Process** to create a new folder.
  Give the folder a name and a description in the popup menu.
  ![create_folder](/images/quick-start-create-process/create_folder.png)

Press **Create Process** to create a new process inside your new folder. For our
  example process we will build a simplified workflow of an order fulfillment
  in a company, so name the process **Order Fulfillment**.
  ![create_process](/images/quick-start-create-process/create_process.png)

After creating the process you are now in the editor, so let's have a quick look at the editor UI.
  For keyboard shortcuts, refer to our section for them on this site.
  ![Editor_overview_final](/images/quick-start-create-process/Editor_overview_final.png)

#### Basic Editor Functions

Every process begins with a start event, so your newly created process already contains one by default.
  Click on the start event element to reveal the quick access toolbar.
  Here you find the **wrench icon** which lets you change between different element types.
  Our example case begins with receiving an order from a customer, so change the element to a **message start event**.
  ![modify_start_event](/images/quick-start-create-process/modify_start_event.png)

Double-clicking the element lets you name it in a small text-box which is also movable for readability.
  Name your message start event something like **Customer order received**.
  Tip: Shift-Enter completes the editing inside the text-box.
  ![name_start_element](/images/quick-start-create-process/name_start_element.png)

Clicking on your start event again, you will find the **Append Task** option to quickly connect a new task
  with your event. Name the new task by double-clicking again, something like **Check availability of components**.
  ![append_task](/images/quick-start-create-process/append_task.png)

Tasks are also modifiable, so you can change your new task to a different kind using the **wrench icon** again.
  In this case a **script task** would make sense to check for availability in a database.
![modify_task](/images/quick-start-create-process/modify_task.png)

Some elements are only found in the **toolbar** on the **left side**. To check for availability of components,
  we will reference a warehouse database, so you can drag-and-drop the **data store element** underneath your task
  and name it **Warehouse Database**.
![left_toolbar_data_store_reference](/images/quick-start-create-process/left_toolbar_data_store_reference.png)

To **connect elements**, simply click on the element you want the connection to root from and use the **arrow icon**
  in the quick access toolbar to draw a connection to another element, in this case from the task to the database.
![connect_elements](/images/quick-start-create-process/connect_elements.png)

#### Gateways

Let's add some logic to our process! Use the **Append gateway** button from the toolbar to quickly connect a new gateway.
![append_gateway](/images/quick-start-create-process/append_gateway.png)

Gateways offer a way to model different process flows. The default gateway in the editor is an **XOR gateway**,
  marked with an X inside, meaning the process can only follow one path going out from this element.
  Name the gateway **All components available?**, append a task and double-click the connecting arrow to name it **Yes**.
![name_connections](/images/quick-start-create-process/name_connections.png)

Name the appended task **Move order to production facility**. For conciseness, from now on in this guide we will only change 
task types if it is necessary for the logic of the process. Continue by appending another task to the gateway,
naming it **Procurement** and the connection **No** as shown below.
![add_production_and_procurement](/images/quick-start-create-process/add_production_and_procurement.png)

Another type of gate is a **parallel gate**, allowing for multiple tasks to run at the same time. It is indicated by a + sign.
  Add another gate to the business rule task and change it into a parallel gate using the wrench icon.
![add_parallel_gate](/images/quick-start-create-process/add_parallel_gate.png)

The individual paths of a parallel gate usually **re-unite** in another **parallel gate**. Append the tasks and the gate as shown
  below.
![complete_parallel_gate](/images/quick-start-create-process/complete_parallel_gate.png)

#### Properties Panel + Meta Information

To modify elements beyond their type and add **meta information** further modifications can be made using the **Properties Panel**.
  If no element is selected, the properties added are for the entire process, otherwise for the currently selected element.
  Select the **Assemble** task and open the panel, either clicking the icon
  in the top right or use  **`Ctrl` or `⌘` + `Enter`** 
![open_properties_panel](/images/quick-start-create-process/open_properties_panel.png)

In the Properties Panel you find a lot of options to add further data to each element or change their appearance for 
  easier legibility. Use the pre-made **duration property** for example to give the **Create bill** task a custom duration in the **popup menu**.
![set_duration](/images/quick-start-create-process/set_duration.png)

You also have the option of introducing your own **custom properties** with their own custom values.
  For example, select the **Assemble product** element, enter a property name like **resources required** and give it a value.
![set_custom_property](/images/quick-start-create-process/set_custom_property.png)

Another feature in the **Properties Panel** are **Milestones**. As the name implies, these are typically used to indicate progress
  within a process. Append a task to the closing parallel gate as shown below, select the connecting line and **add a milestone**.
  In the popup window, give the milestone an **ID**, a **name** and a **description**.
![add_milestone](/images/quick-start-create-process/add_milestone.png)

It should be indicated where a milestone can be reached in the process model. Use the **Add text annotation button** to append
  a text field to the connection line that triggers the milestone. For better legibility, feel free to **color** the text field as well.
![add_text_annotation_for_milestone](/images/quick-start-create-process/add_text_annotation_for_milestone.png)

Each flow direction of the process has to end in an **end event**. Append one and call it **Order fulfilled** to complete this
  side of the XOR gateway.
![add_end_event_for_yes_fork](/images/quick-start-create-process/add_end_event_for_yes_fork.png)

Before we finish this tutorial by completing the *No* side of the gateway, you can compare your current result to this
  interim result below. Use the **lasso** and **space removal** tools from the **left-side toolbar** to refactor your model to
  be similar to this, especially moving **Procurement** further down and giving the **Yes** arrow some extra space,
  to make the next few steps a bit smoother.
![interim_result](/images/quick-start-create-process/interim_result.png)

#### Pools + Participants

In the **left-hand toolbar**, you find the button for **Create pool/participant**. This allows us to divide the model
  into different **sections** of different **participants** to further improve legibility of **responsibilities**.
  Click it and onto your schema to encompass your entire current model in a pool and give it a company **name** by double-clicking
  on the **left** side of the box.
![create_pool](/images/quick-start-create-process/create_pool.png)

When selecting the entire pool you get some options in the **top-right corner** to further **separate** your schema into or
  add additional sections. Click the **Divide into two lanes** option.
  **Note:** When deleting a pool, you also delete its contents! But don't worry, the undo-button in the top left corner
  or pressing  **`Ctrl` or `⌘` + `Z`** gives you back your work.
![dividing_line](/images/quick-start-create-process/dividing_line.png)

You now have a pool **split** into two groups of participants and can select each participant compartment separately.
  **Expand** the bottom compartment to give you a bit more room. **Double-clicking** in the **left-front** of the compartment lets
  you name it like you've done with elements. Name the particpants **Manufacturing & Logistics** and **Procurement Department**.
![naming_participants](/images/quick-start-create-process/naming_participants.png)

#### Sub-processes

Another type of task is a **sub-process**, meaning you can build an entire process **inside** one task element. You have the option
  between a **collapsed** or **expanded** version, but for legibility we will go with the collapsed version here that is marked with a **+** inside of it.
![make_procurement_sub-process](/images/quick-start-create-process/make_procurement_sub-process.png)

You have two options to open a collapsed sub-process, either with the **button** on top of the page or with the **arrow** in the bottom right corner.
![open_subprocess](/images/quick-start-create-process/open_subprocess.png)

Now inside the sub-process you could freely build an entire new process. Of course **Procurement** would be a big and complicated process,
  but for simplicity we will just leave this sub-process empty. You can navigate back to your model using the **Back to parent** button
  in the top left corner.
![back_to_parent](/images/quick-start-create-process/back_to_parent.png)

#### Boundary events

One of the last things we want to demonstrate is something you might have been waiting for if you are familiar with BPMN already.
  To create a boundary event, **drag-and-drop** an event from the **left-side toolbar** and attach it to an element, in our case the **Procurement** task.
![create_boundary_event](/images/quick-start-create-process/create_boundary_event.png)

![drag_event_to_task](/images/quick-start-create-process/drag_event_to_task.png)

Using the **wrench icon**, change the event to an **error boundary event**. Name it **Undeliverable**.
![modify_to_error_boundary_event](/images/quick-start-create-process/modify_to_error_boundary_event.png)

Drag-and-drop another event to the **Procurement** task and change it to an **escalation boundary event (non-interrupting)**.
  Name it **Late Delivery**.
![add_escalation_boundary_non-interrupting](/images/quick-start-create-process/add_escalation_boundary_non-interrupting.png)

If the **Procurement** (sub-)process cannot resolve the issue of the missing components, this boundary error event would be
  triggered, which is why we called it **Undeliverable**. This being an **interrupting event**, as indicated by the **solid lines**,
  defines that the **process ends** here. After cancelling the order the process ends in a **message end event** 
  called **Order cancelled**, informing the customer.
![cancel_order](/images/quick-start-create-process/cancel_order.png)

The **Late Delivery** event is a **non-interrupting event**, meaning the main flow of the process does not have to go through
  this path if this event is triggered. The **Procurement** (sub-)process can keep running, trying to acquire the missing components,
  and at some point triggers this event to inform the customer about the delayed delivery. The flow from this event
  to notify the customer also needs to stop somewhere, so it ends in an end event called **Customer informed of late delivery**.
![late_delivery](/images/quick-start-create-process/late_delivery.png)

#### Finishing the diagram

If the **Procurement** process is (eventually) successful, the order can be fulfilled, meaning the flow returns to the
  **Manufacturing & Logistics** department. To not miss any steps, the flow has to continue right after the **All components available?** gate.
  To achieve this, one uses an **XOR gateway** to **merge** two incoming flows. Simply drag one from the left-side toolbar onto the **Yes** arrow.
![xor_merge_gateway](/images/quick-start-create-process/xor_merge_gateway.png)

Once the **Procurement** process is finished gathering the missing components, without triggering the **Undeliverable** event 
  and potentially after triggering the **Late Delivery** event, the order can now move to a production facility.
  You can now link **Procurement** directly to the newly added XOR gateway to merge two incoming flows and your simplified order fulfillment diagram is **complete**.
![merge_procurement](/images/quick-start-create-process/merge_procurement.png)

This concludes our process creation tutorial for the BPMN editor of **PROCEED**. You have now used most tools of
  the editor UI, built a reasonable process according to BPMN standards and are ready to create your own models.  
  **Enjoy using our tools and thank you for using PROCEED!**
