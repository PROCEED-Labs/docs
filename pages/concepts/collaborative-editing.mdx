**Content:** This is an interesting transaction topic: 

- how to concurrently work on one document (process) without blocking? e.g.
  google docs, etc.
- how to synchronize sub-documents (scripts, html, etc.)?

{/* - requirement: ACID
  - Atomicity: the changes should be available for every client or for none
  - Consistency: of course
  - Isolation: goal == no isolation
  - Durability: of course
  - => sind CAP Theorem und BASE-Prinzip (Eventual Consistency) relevant? (keine
    mehrere Server) */}

### What data is synchronized for collaborative editing?

- the events (name + modification data + author + date) that bpmn-js emits
  events, if something was changed inside the GUI
- also emit events if something is directly changes inside the BPMN
  (Constraints, Name, ID, Extensions, etc.)
- **Question:** can an event also be emitted immediately when there is something
  changed inside the HTML, Script, Constraint View? (not the whole script)

{/* - it could also just be the changed BPMN file, but this is much more data
and would require blocking at some point (see Client version) */}

### What needs to be done for synchronizing?

1. emit event
2. change BPMN process
3. verify: check if the changed BPMN is the same on all the other systems
    - if not: re-sync and get correct BPMN

### How to sync the changes to every client?

- there are two versions: 1. the server has the source of truth, or 2. the
  client has the source of truth

Main PROBLEMS to solve:

- two clients work concurrently on the same process and should not override any
  changes from the others

Minor Problems:

- How is the time synchronized over all Client for `lastModificationDate`?
  - goal: see the time of the last modification
  - the Server can **not** add a date to the event because the triggering client
    does not receive its own event, but instead incorporates its changes by
    himself => but if the client has another time than all the other clients,
    the process hash is different
  - Solution 1: when initialized server sends time to the client, client manages
    this time and use it (not the system time) 
  - Solution 2: last modification is not a time, but a unique id
- What happens to the Back- and Forward-Buttons?
  - Can everybody revert (back) the changes from others?


#### The server truth

- the server incorporates all changes into the BPMN process
  - every client also does it for itself

**Verify that every editing client has the latest version:**

- after incorporating _all_ open changes, the server sends a hash of the new
  process to all registered clients
- Client validate the hash with their version and requests a complete process
  update, if it is not the same
- PROBLEM: the incorporation is done in parallel on every system (server and
  clients)
  - if there are many change events, one system can be faster than the other
  - if the server is faster than the client, the client gets a process hash
    before it finished the incorporation of all changes
    - => the client needs to check against the same "version" as the server had
      for calculating the hash
    - SOLUTION 1 (simple, maybe not sufficient): just compare when the
      incorporation of all events on the Client is finished (if there is a hash
      update from the server, just **override** the existing hash)
    - SOLUTION 2 (more complex): in addition to the hash, send which (last 10)
      events have been incorporated in the hash and compare it

#### The client truth

- the client send the change event to the server, which distributes it
- the client calculates the new BPMN process
- the client sends the new process to the server
  - the server stores this version as the _latest_ version
- verification as before with hashes

**PROBLEM:**
- too many problem with concurrent editing on multiple clients in parallel: if
  both clients send the BPMN to the server at the same time, which one is then
  the correct one?
  - it would require blocking again, which we want to avoid
