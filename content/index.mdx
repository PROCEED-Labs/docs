PROCEED (PROCess EnginE in a Distributed environment) is a _decentralized
Business Process Management System (dBPMS)_ with the goal of developing a
process engine that is not centrally running on one Server. It aims to
distribute the execution of process steps directly to all kinds of heterogeneous
IoT Machines. This concept is aligned with the recent evolution of IT systems to
switch from a centralized client-server architecture to a decentralized
peer-to-peer network, whereby devices of all sizes and operating systems in the
vicinity are connected and exchange data in order to fulfill a task. This can
have many advantages, for example:

- _Offline Execution_: Executing a process step directly on a machine and
  sending the next process step to the next machine, does not require the
  connection to a central (cloud) server. This can be very interesting for
  projects with no stable network connection.
- _Network load:_ Sending vast amounts of data over a network (potentially
  across continents to cloud service providers) causes latency and congestion.
  By pre-processing the data close to the user these effects are reduced.
- _Smart usage of resources:_ The “Fog/Edge Computing” approach makes sure that
  resources close to the user are used instead of delegating calculation tasks
  to a central cloud instance. This helps to ensure an effective use of the
  available resources and better end user experience.
- _Privacy:_ If sensible data is processed close to the user and not sent to a
  centralized server, possible misuse of data is avoided and data protection is
  enhanced.
- _Easy Integrations:_ We offer a Process Engine that can be installed on many
  different devices. By adhering to the BPMN standard, it is easy to transform
  existing processes, distribute the execution to different Machines and let
  them work together. Moreover, we are able to use the capabilities of a Machine
  in the execution steps, so you don’t need to connect to a heavy or proprietary
  API.
- _Reliability:_ Instead of having one central point of failure that potentially
  influence the execution of multiple processes, PROCEED distributes the
  execution to many Machines. If there is a critical error this can only affect
  the processes that are currently also executed on the same Machine, and can
  not influence all other processes.

The project and its software is developed open-source on GitHub:
