To deploy and execute a process you have to install PROCEEDs _Distributed
Process Engine_ at least on one _Machine_ (computer, server, microcontoller,
smartphone, etc.). Depending on your use case, it is probably useful to install
a multitude of Engines on several Machines.

## Distributed Process Engine Download

[For Windows/Linux/MAC
(Node.js-Version)](https://storage.googleapis.com/proceed-releases/engine/PROCEED-Engine-0.1.0.zip):
For starting the Engine you just need to unzip the file, have a Node.js version
of v12.x+ installed and then run `node proceed-engine.js`

[For
Android](https://storage.googleapis.com/proceed-releases/engine/PROCEED-Engine-0.1.0.apk)
(Note: this is still compiled with the _debug_ flag, but should be sufficient
for testing. A _production_ version is release soon.)

For iOS (coming soon)

Start in the your browser (coming soon)

#### Systemd Service on Linux

If you want to run the Engine at startup on Linux, there is a systemd service
file inside the zip called `proceed-engine.service`. A detailed description
which values needs to be changed and how to enable the service, can be found [in
the README file on
Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/dBPMS-PROCEED/proceed#linux-systemd-service).

## Docker version

There is an up-to-date docker image of the PROCEED Engine. Unfortunately this
**only works on Linux completely** where you can use the `--network host` option
(the Docker container uses the network interface of the host). This is necessary
because the Engine uses mDNS for the discovery process.

> `docker container run --detach --network host --name engine
> proceed/engine:latest`

If you want to stop the Engine again:

> `docker container stop engine`

You can also start the Engine on other operating systems, but this disables the
mDNS-based discovery. Therefore, in the Management System you need to add the
Engine manually via _Add_ in the Machine View.

> `docker container run --detach --publish 33029:33029 --name engine
> proceed/engine:latest`

## Firewall

By default, the PROCEED Engine uses port 33029 for communication and port 5353
for mDNS-based discovery purposes.

{/* TODOs:
- always latest version from git
- and one stable version
- capability install

### Capability Installation

npm run ist intended, but because git is only for internals: download */}
